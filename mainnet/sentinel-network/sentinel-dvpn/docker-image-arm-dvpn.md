## SENTINEL NETWORK

The Sentinel Network is a decentralized, blockchain-based node marketplace where anyone can buy and sell bandwidth, enabling multiple VPN providers access to its network offering users enhanced privacy and security through a more diversified, robust, and competitive framework than other VPN applications and bandwidth providers. Anyone can build a dVPN application on top of Sentinel that is more secure and trustworthy than any centralized VPN application.

## SENTINEL NODE

Sentinel nodes form the backbone of the Sentinel Network by providing decentralized bandwidth for its VPN services, enhancing privacy and security. Operated by individuals globally and incentivized with rewards like $DVPN tokens, these nodes ensure a resilient, distributed network that resists censorship and promotes secure, community-driven internet access. ‚Äç Currently community members can host dVPN nodes that support either the Wireguard or the V2Ray protocol.
